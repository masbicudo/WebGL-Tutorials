# Things to do

### General

- Maybe this repo should be devoted to Computer Graphics in general instead of WebGL only.

### Easy

- Post content about ray marching... I had given only the code without explanations.
- Drawing triangle strips with WebGL (must find this code and commit it into this repo)

### Medium

- Using WebGL to integrate functions numerically

### Hard

- Visualizing ray marching with WebGL
- CG discipline final work in three.js
